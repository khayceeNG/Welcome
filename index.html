        <h3>
            My First Weed Edible Experience 
        </h3>
        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Weed edibles are the bomb, it could be in any form, 
            from cakes, sweets, ice creams to sauce. And in Nigeria we like it as an ingredient to our jollof rice,
             beans or indomie. But till before now I’ve never had weed in my food for any reason 
             because I could always fine somewhere to smoke.
        </p>

        <p>

        <p>I was back from the university for holiday and the house was full.
             Brothers, sisters and cousins not forgetting my parents, 
             I couldn’t smoke indoors because privacy was off the table. 
             4 days later, I’ve not had a blunt and nothing sounds funny anymore till my cousin Lota
             (not real name) comes to join us and he was going to be staying in my room. 
             At this point, I gave up all hope on privacy and a blunt.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="/images/2h0s3p-1105696773.jpg">
        </p>
           
        <p>The next day, Lota and I are talking –Lota doesn’t smoke but knows I do, 
            and he was like “<i><b>Yo! do you still smoke weed?</b>
            </i>” I stared at him and tears almost poured from my eyes, I said “<b>
                <i>Not since I came back home, someone is always coming through the door</i>
            </b>”. So we keep talking and next thing, we start researching ways to consume weed without smoking 
            and our two options at the moment were.
        </p>
        <p>
            1.Put the weed while cooking beans or jollof rice.
        </p>
        <p>
            2.Make canna milk
        </p>
        <p>
            We couldn’t cook with weed in the food, I mean we had people over.
             Who could guaranty no one would grab a piece before you find out because there will be hungry
              and gluttony adults/teenagers. Plus, how do I deal with the little ones if they found out? 
              “<b>Sorry little kids, Uncle can’t give you this food because he has laced it with weed</b>”. 
              So I picked option 2 and waited till midnight.<br>
        At 12 a.m., Everyone was sleeping while my cousin and I were in the kitchen making my first edible. 
        <b>NOTE</b>, we did our research on the internet 
        and everyone was talking measurement like 
        “Place 5 grams of weed in your 30 litres of milk while…”
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="/images/2h0t8c769402381.jpg">
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;… First of all, weed in Nigeria is not measured in grams but as the spirit leads,
             and they were making the simplest thing complicated with all the measurement and shit. 
             So Lota and I just poured two little bags of SK into my milk and closed the pot.&nbsp;
             An hour later, I come back to check and the kitchen was smelling fucked, I felt like shit “Canna
             <b><i>why didn’t anyone say it’ll smell this terrible</i></b>
             ”. Unfortunately, I was supposed to cook for 3 hours and it was going to be worse anyways.
              3 hours later, my “Canna Milk” was ready but it was morning so I went to bed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later that same day, Lota and I were talking then he asked me “<i><b>How was the milk</b></i>? 
            <b><i>was it bitter</i></b>?”, I asked “<i><b>What milk</b></i>? <b><i>Oh shit</i></b>! 
            <b><i>yesterday</i></b>”. I had forgotten about it. We go back to the room and I get the milk 
            from the fridge. I had a little and after an hour I wasn’t feeling anything. 
            I told my cousin, #he said “<i><b>Are you sure you did it right? or maybe you drank a little?”
                &nbsp;</b></i>So I drink a little more and 30 mins later, Nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was mad, I had just wasted 2 potential blunt materials. 
            So in anger I drank half the bottle and talked with Lota a bit before going to bed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Few minutes later while I’m sleeping, my dreams become weird like I was awake and yet not awake
             at the same time. I could feel I was weightless &amp; floating . The feeling is all fun till I
              remembered I was supposed to be on my bed then I woke up with Lota staring at me and the first 
              thing I say is “<b><i>Dude, I swear I’m high af</i></b>” and starts laughing. I tried walking 
              around the house but I felt it was more like floating and sometimes sinking really slow into 
              the ground –Lota said I looked like a creepy smiling zombie with red eyes. I was hungry and 
              ate everything and anything I could see. Played games and zoned out a lot which led to Lota
               winning the whole time.&nbsp;
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>The music was so extra, like I could feel it literally and there was too much inspiration 
            in each line on every song, and when I hear line I’ve not heard of and realized how deep it is,
             my mind be like&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>&nbsp; –Luckily my parents were out and I went back to bed later.<br>
        2 hours later I wake up and I’m still high. Brethren that high lasted 
        for 11–12 hours before I was sober again. The next day I’m staring at the remaining half of my
         “<b><i>Canna Milk</i></b>”, and boy was I ready for another trip.&nbsp;
